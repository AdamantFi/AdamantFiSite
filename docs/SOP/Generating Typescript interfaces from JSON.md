# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Generating TypeScript Interfaces from JSON

## Purpose

The purpose of this SOP is to guide developers through the process of generating TypeScript interfaces from JSON data. This ensures a type-safe development environment, promoting robust and error-resistant code. Two methods will be discussed: using an online tool and a CLI tool.

## Scope

This SOP is applicable to all software development projects within the organization that use TypeScript and require JSON data manipulation.

## Responsibilities

- **Developers** are responsible for implementing the procedures as outlined in this SOP.
- **Project Managers** are responsible for ensuring their team members are familiar with and adhere to this SOP.
- **Technical Leads** are responsible for providing support and guidance to the developers in the execution of these procedures.

## Procedure

### Method 1: Using an Online Tool

1. **Prepare JSON Data**: Ensure that your JSON data is ready for conversion. This can be data received from an API, stored in a file, or any JSON string.

2. **Access the Online Tool**: Open a web browser and navigate to [Transform Tools](https://transform.tools/json-to-typescript).

3. **Input JSON Data**: In the left pane of the website, paste your JSON data.

4. **Generate TypeScript Interfaces**: The website will automatically convert the JSON data into TypeScript interfaces, displayed in the right pane.

5. **Copy TypeScript Interfaces**: Review the generated TypeScript interfaces for accuracy and then copy them.

6. **Integrate into Your Project**: Paste the copied TypeScript interfaces into your TypeScript project where necessary.

### Method 2: Using `quicktype` CLI Tool

1. **Install `quicktype`**:

   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the command `npm install -g quicktype` to install `quicktype` globally.

2. **Prepare JSON Data**: Similar to Method 1, ensure your JSON data is ready.

3. **Generate TypeScript Interface**:

   - For JSON data in a file, use: `quicktype -s json <path-to-your-json> -o Output.ts --just-types`.
   - For JSON data as a string, use: `echo '<your-json-string>' | quicktype -s json -o Output.ts --just-types`.
   - Replace `<path-to-your-json>` with the path to your JSON file, and `<your-json-string>` with your JSON string.

4. **Review and Integrate**: Review the `Output.ts` file generated by `quicktype`, adjust as necessary, and integrate it into your project.

## Conclusion

Both methods offer efficient ways to generate TypeScript interfaces from JSON data. The choice between using an online tool or a CLI tool like `quicktype` depends on the developer's preference, the complexity of the JSON data, and the project requirements. By following this SOP, developers can ensure consistent and type-safe handling of JSON data across all projects.
