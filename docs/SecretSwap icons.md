# SecretSwap Token Icons

## Token Icons on SecretSwap

SecretSwap uses a variety of icons to represent different tokens within its ecosystem. These icons play a crucial role in providing a visual representation of the various cryptocurrencies and tokens available for trading, staking, and other activities on the platform.

### Where to Find Token Icons

The token icons used by SecretSwap are stored within a static directory in the project's GitHub repository. This ensures that developers, designers, and users can easily access and reference the icons as needed.

### Location of Token Icons

The icons are located in the `static` folder of the SecretSwapSite repository on GitHub. You can browse and download the icons directly from the following URL:

[SecretSwapSite/static directory on GitHub](https://github.com/scrtlabs/SecretSwapSite/tree/main/public/static)

### Example Token Icons

Here is a small sample of the filenames for some of the token icons available in the `static` directory:

Please note that the filenames and the availability of certain icons may change as new tokens are added to the SecretSwap ecosystem and the repository is updated. It is a good practice to check the repository periodically for the latest icons and updates.
