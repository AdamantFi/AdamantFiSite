# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current SmartSearchBox component is a monolithic 1022-line file with all search strategies, parsing logic, and UI concerns bundled together. This refactor aims to create a modular, maintainable, and extensible smart search system that separates concerns, improves testability, and enables easier feature development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular search architecture, so that I can easily add new search strategies without modifying existing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new search strategy is needed THEN the system SHALL allow adding it without modifying existing strategy files
2. WHEN implementing a search strategy THEN the system SHALL provide a consistent interface for all strategies
3. WHEN multiple strategies match a query THEN the system SHALL rank results by confidence scores
4. WHEN a strategy fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors without breaking other strategies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want separated parsing logic, so that I can test and maintain command parsing independently from UI components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing user input THEN the system SHALL extract commands, tokens, and amounts using dedicated parser modules
2. WHEN token matching is needed THEN the system SHALL use a dedicated token resolver service
3. WHEN voice input is processed THEN the system SHALL use a separate voice processing module
4. WHEN parsing fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error information for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean component structure, so that UI concerns are separated from business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering search results THEN the system SHALL use dedicated suggestion components
2. WHEN handling user interactions THEN the system SHALL delegate to appropriate service layers
3. WHEN managing component state THEN the system SHALL use focused state management hooks
4. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use consistent design system patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing search functionality to work exactly as before, so that the refactor doesn't break my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN typing search queries THEN the system SHALL provide the same suggestions as the current implementation
2. WHEN executing commands THEN the system SHALL perform the same actions as the current implementation
3. WHEN using voice input THEN the system SHALL process speech with the same accuracy as before
4. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL respond to the same shortcuts and navigation patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing parsers THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for all parsing scenarios
2. WHEN implementing strategies THEN the system SHALL include tests for suggestion generation
3. WHEN implementing components THEN the system SHALL include integration tests for user interactions
4. WHEN refactoring THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve current test coverage levels

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and examples, so that I can easily understand and extend the search system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new strategies THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation on the strategy interface
2. WHEN working with parsers THEN the system SHALL include examples of common parsing patterns
3. WHEN integrating components THEN the system SHALL provide usage examples and API documentation
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL include troubleshooting guides and common patterns
